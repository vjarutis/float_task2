                            Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science.

                            Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically   mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel  Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of   the law of the photoelectric effect.

                            Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist    and inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known    for many revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th    and early 20th centuries.
